# Feedback Summary

## Customizability and Layout
- Website lacks the easy customization of website builders.
- Improve automatic scaling for better responsiveness.
- Add a second wave design (e.g., before FAQs/footer) for visual appeal.

## FAQs
- Split FAQs into **3 categories** with dropdowns for tidier navigation and keyword optimization.
- Reframe "full insurance" statement as an FAQ:
  **Q:** What happens if I'm not satisfied/there's an issue with my house clean?
  **A:** We are not Cowboy contractors. Our full-time customer support team is dedicated to providing you with a premium experience before, during, and after your GoClean service. If you have any issues, please contact us at any time, and our team will work tirelessly to find a solution. For extra peace of mind, GoClean has the means to financially compensate any damages, with insurance cover up to $1,000,000.

## Aesthetic Improvements
- Improve text box design and picture sizing.
- Change footer color to match the website theme (current dark blue is unappealing).
- Update the logo with a **better font** (current one is bland).
- Add a **sparkle effect** to letters in the logo (e.g., the "e" and "a") to resemble detergent ads.

## Overall Suggestions
- Work on design and user experience to make the site visually appealing and professional.
